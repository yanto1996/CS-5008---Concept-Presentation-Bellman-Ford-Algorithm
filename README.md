Welcome to the Bellman-Ford Algorithm Final Project!

This project presents a comprehensive look at the Bellman-Ford Algorithm, which is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph that may have negative edge weights. The algorithm is an iterative process that relaxes the edges of the graph until the shortest path is found.

The project includes a slide presentation that covers the key concepts of the Bellman-Ford Algorithm and its applications. The handout provides a detailed explanation of the algorithm's steps, as well as pseudocode used in the implementation.

The code files include the actual code for the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. The code is implemented in C, and is designed to be easy to understand and follow. The code includes comments that explain each step in the algorithm, making it an excellent resource for anyone interested in learning how to implement the Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

Overall, this project is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn about the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. Whether you are a student studying algorithms or a professional developer looking for an efficient way to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, this project has something for you. We hope you find this project informative!
